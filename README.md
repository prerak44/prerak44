Hi, Iâ€™m @prerak44, I keep interest in Machine Learning and Python programming.
I'm learning machine learning with, of course, Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
I have recently procured ESP8266 modules and made a rover with ESP8266-01 as Wi-Fi co-processor and Raspberry Pi Pico as the main processor
to handle all the sensor readings and motor control, I will upload the code, schematics and information for the rover soon.
The ESP8266 handles the website/app for controlling the rover and displaying the sensor readings.
